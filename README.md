# G2Net_Gravitaional_Wave_Detection
Kaggle host a competition called G2Net gravitational wave detection. I participated in this competition along with my team members and submitted three models for the given task in python language.

#### Competition Link: "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/g2net-gravitational-wave-detection/overview".
#### In this competition they provided with a training set of time series data containing simulated gravitational wave measurements from a network of 3 gravitational wave interferometers (LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, and Virgo). Each time series contains either detector noise or detector noise plus a simulated gravitational wave signal.
#### The task is to identify when a signal is present in the data (target=1).
#### We submiited 3 models for the given task
####     Model name           Accuracy            Rank
#### 1. Keras model            0.4983          1165 out of 1219
#### 2. Simple CNN model       0.8351          1019 out of 1219
#### 3. Efficient-Net model    0.8624          578  out of 1219

#### Each model implemented in python language and ran in Kaggle kernel itself.
